Columbia Bootcamp 15 Aug 2021

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to analyze weather trends in Oahu, Hawaii, in an effort to determine if a surf and ice cream shop would be a viable buiness endevor year-round, or if due to fluctuating temperatures, would be limited to only certian months of the year. 

## Results
The analysis consists of 1700 weather readings in June and 1517 recordings in July from weather stations.
- In December and June, the maximum observed temperatures were, respectively, 83 and 85 degrees fahrenheit.
- The average temperatures recorded in December and June were, respectively, 71.0 and 74.9 degrees fahrenheit.
- In December and June, the minumum observed tempratures were, respectively, 56 and 64 degrees fahrenheit.

## Summary
Although the weather is somewhat cooler in December [25% 69 degrees fahrenheit], it remains fairly temprate all year-round, with a maximum recorded value only two degrees off from that of June. Therefore, the surf and ice cream shop would be a viable business prospect as the climate does not appear to fluctuate significantly enough for the business to falter during winter months.
